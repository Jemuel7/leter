    <H1> Hi my baby girl</H1>
    <p>
      Hi, my love. If you're reading this, good. </p>

<p>I just wanna say how much I love you, darling, the times we spent together, the kisses, the hugs, I love it all, especially you.</p>
<p>You know, I’ve been wondering, what am I without you? I like the fact that you changed the course of my life. </p>

<p>I know you've heard this a lot, but I’m glad you came into my life, darling. </p>

<p>The first month, not much happened, it's great and all.</p>
<p>The second month, not much again.</p>
<p>The third month, this is all when it started, the sex thing.</p>
<p>in the fourth month, I don't remember much but all I can say is ps </p>
<p>the fifth month, I still don't remember much:(( but it was great!</p>
<p>the sixth month, well, I’m getting inconsistent again.</p>
<p>All of those months na nagkasama tayo, I cherish all the memories of me and you. It was all a good memory for me.</p>

<p>There's this time, right? the day you fell out of love. I tried everything to work us out, and yet, I feel like I failed. You heard me crying and stuff cause I was hurt so much at that time. I can't imagine you would feel it; the feeling of it was like a truck hit you at high speed.</p>

<p>But then, you told me, “Can we try again?” and I said yes, we can, and it worked out perfectly, and now, I’m the one being inconsistent.</p>
<p>I will try to do my best to love you, my babyPookiee. I want you to feel that you're loved. I don't want you to feel hurt. I was avoiding things that can hurt you, lalo na yung inconsistency.</p>
<p>The fact that I didn't notice I was being inconsistent is so frustrating, cause how could I not have noticed that</p>

<p>Anyway, I love you, my baby; I want you to live, so don't die yet, or I will be mad. Don't kill yourself ahh; if you are feeling down, just go to me, okay? I’ll be here by your side always. I’ll always support you in everything you do darling. ( Just not killing, cheating ), I hope we will last for eternity, even if we have ups and downs, we can work it out, right? </p>


<p>==Apologies==</p>

I’m sorry for being inconsistent and not noticing it, and like, the updates every hour which made you feel like, it's just an obligation to chat you.

<br>I’m sorry I made you feel that way, darling. I always try my best to be the best partner you could ever have ( I wanna be your best partner so that you can't forget about me ) Hihi</br>

<br>Sadly, the letter you gave me, I can't find it. Don't worry, baby, I still cherish it in my heart, and it will always have a space in my heart.</br>

<p>This is my shortest letter yet.</p>

<p>I love you so much baby:}, don't fell out of love, please.</p>

<p>From: Jemuel, your best partner based on me</p>
